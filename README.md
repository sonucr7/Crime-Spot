## Tech Stack: ðŸ‘‡
Crime-Spot uses a number of languages, libraries, frameworks, and APIs to work properly:

- **Python** - General Purpose Language **(For Machine Learning in this case)**.
- **JavaScript** - For integration of Google Maps, model functions and all related web functionalities in the front-end.
- **Flask** - Awesome microservice of Python for Web Apps.
- **Google Map API**- You will need "Google Map API Key" from your Google Cloud Console. It is chargable. 
- **Heroku** - For deploying the model on a PaaS.

Then run the below command to open the app in browser, 
```sh
python3 app.py
```

## Todo: ðŸ‘‡

+ User Authentication and Management
+ Patrolling management system
+ Push notification to the Patrolling department
+ PDF Report generation of the predicted hotspots on the Map
